As a starting point for x11iraf I've unzipped the file:

x11iraf-v2.0BETA-src.tar.gz

which I grabbed from ftp://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/x11iraf

In my opinion this really should be part of the github.com/iraf
respository set. But so far no progress has been made toward this so
I'm starting my own repository that anyone who would like can contribute to.

I'm planning on a couple of branches for any udpdates,
merge-all: will combine all of the updates
porting:   will be used for Raspberry Pi and other platforms defined
           as non-standard by IRAF.

This will be for non-commerical use and my goal is to not step on any
license agreements.
